### Website or blog?

Structure difference: [Websites](website.html) are just collections of pages you can navigate to via the menu, whereas [blogs](blog.html) have collections of posts that can be indexed and syndicated (via their RSS feed). Distill blogs are a distill website with added blog posts.

Workflow difference: Furthermore, *website* pages and root pages of *blogs* are re-rendered when the site is rebuilt but blog articles are not. Each blog article has to be rendered on its own, with intent. Why? Given that R package upgrades have a tendency to break older code, continuously re-rendering old posts is nearly impossible to do without errors, especially over longer periods of time.
